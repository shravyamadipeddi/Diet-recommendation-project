🥗 Diet Recommendation System

This project is a **Diet Recommendation System** that suggests personalized meal plans and nutrition tips based on a user’s health data, age, gender, and lifestyle.  
It helps users maintain a balanced diet by analyzing their Body Mass Index (BMI) and providing suitable diet suggestions.
